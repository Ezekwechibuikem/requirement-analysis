## Requirement Analysis in Software Development
üìò About the Project

The Requirement Analysis Project builds a solid foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system.
This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to ensure successful project execution.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

Master the principles and methodologies of Requirement Analysis within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

Translate project needs into structured documentation.

Identify and categorize functional and non-functional requirements for scalable systems.

Use tools like Draw.io for visual system representations.

Define clear acceptance criteria that align with user and business goals.

Apply best practices to produce industry-standard documentation and diagrams.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It serves as the foundation of the Software Development Life Cycle (SOLC), ensuring that the final product aligns with user goals, business objectives, and technical feasibility.

During this phase, developers, project managers, and stakeholders collaborate to define what the system should do (functional requirements) and how it should perform (non-functional requirements). The outcome is a clear, structured set of requirements that guide the design, development, and testing stages of the project.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

### Requirement Analysis involves several important activities to ensure the software meets user expectations and business goals.

Below are the five key activities involved:

- Requirement Gathering
Collecting all relevant information from stakeholders, users, and clients to understand what the system should do. This may involve interviews, surveys, or reviewing existing documentation.

- Requirement Elicitation
Engaging stakeholders through discussions, workshops, and observation to uncover hidden needs and clarify ambiguous requirements.

- Requirement Documentation
Organizing and writing down all gathered and elicited requirements in a clear, structured format (e.g., Software Requirement Specification - SRS) for easy understanding by both technical and non-technical teams.

- Requirement Analysis and Modeling
Evaluating requirements for feasibility, consistency, and completeness. Creating models such as data flow diagrams (DFDs), use cases, or UML diagrams to represent the system‚Äôs functionality visually.

- Requirement Validation
Ensuring that the documented requirements align with the actual needs of users and stakeholders. This step helps identify missing, conflicting, or misunderstood requirements before development begins.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it ensures that the project starts with a clear understanding of user needs and business goals. Here are three key reasons why it‚Äôs important:

### 1. Prevents Miscommunication and Scope Creep
By clearly defining what the system should do, Requirement Analysis reduces misunderstandings between developers, clients, and stakeholders. This helps prevent costly changes or ‚Äúscope creep‚Äù during development.

### 2. Saves Time and Resources
Identifying requirements early helps detect potential risks and technical challenges before development begins. This reduces rework and ensures the project stays on schedule and within budget.

### 3. Improves Software Quality
A well-defined set of requirements acts as a guide for design, coding, and testing. It ensures that the final product aligns with user expectations and business objectives, resulting in higher-quality software.

## Types of Requirements

In software engineering, requirements are broadly classified into two main categories ‚Äî Functional and Non-functional requirements.
These help define what the system should do and how well it should perform.

### 1. Functional Requirements

**Definition:**
Functional requirements describe the specific features, behaviors, and functions that the system must perform. They define what the system should do to meet user and business needs.

*Examples for a Booking Management Project:*

- The system should allow users to create a new booking for available rooms or services.

- The system should send booking confirmation emails to users after successful payment.

- The system should allow administrators to view, edit, and cancel bookings.

- The system should provide search functionality to find bookings by date, customer name, or booking ID.

- The system should display available slots or rooms based on the user‚Äôs selected date and time.

### 2. Non-functional Requirements

**Definition:**
Non-functional requirements define the quality attributes of the system ‚Äî how the system performs rather than what it does. These include performance, reliability, security, usability, and scalability.

*Examples for a Booking Management Project:*

- The system should respond to user requests within 3 seconds under normal load.

- The website should be accessible on all major browsers and mobile devices.

- User data must be encrypted and stored securely to prevent unauthorized access.

- The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.

- The system should have 99.9% uptime availability to ensure reliability.

## Use Case Diagrams
### What is a Use Case Diagram?

A Use Case Diagram is a visual representation used in Requirement Analysis to show the interaction between users (actors) and the system (use cases).
It helps identify who will use the system and what actions they can perform.

### Benefits of Use Case Diagrams

- Simplifies the understanding of system functionality.

- Helps in identifying user interactions and system boundaries.

- Serves as a foundation for requirement documentation and system design.

- Improves communication between developers, clients, and stakeholders.

### Use Case Diagram for Booking Management System

- Customer ‚Äì books, views, and cancels bookings.

- Admin ‚Äì manages users, updates booking details, and monitors the system.

- Payment System ‚Äì handles payment transactions.

**Use Cases**

- Register / Login

- View Available Rooms / Services

- Make a Booking

- Cancel Booking

- Process Payment

- Manage Bookings (Admin)

- Generate Reports (Admin)
