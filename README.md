## Requirement Analysis in Software Development
üìò About the Project

The Requirement Analysis Project builds a solid foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system.
This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to ensure successful project execution.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

Master the principles and methodologies of Requirement Analysis within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

Translate project needs into structured documentation.

Identify and categorize functional and non-functional requirements for scalable systems.

Use tools like Draw.io for visual system representations.

Define clear acceptance criteria that align with user and business goals.

Apply best practices to produce industry-standard documentation and diagrams.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It serves as the foundation of the Software Development Life Cycle (SOLC), ensuring that the final product aligns with user goals, business objectives, and technical feasibility.

During this phase, developers, project managers, and stakeholders collaborate to define what the system should do (functional requirements) and how it should perform (non-functional requirements). The outcome is a clear, structured set of requirements that guide the design, development, and testing stages of the project.

### üîç Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- Requirement Gathering: Collecting needs from clients, users, and other stakeholders.

- Requirement Documentation: Clearly recording all identified requirements in structured formats.

- Requirement Classification: Categorizing into functional and non-functional requirements.

- Requirement Validation: Ensuring that all requirements are realistic, complete, and align with business goals.

- Requirement Management: Maintaining and updating requirements as the project evolves.

üöÄ Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC

- Clarity and Focus: Prevents ambiguity by defining what the software must achieve before development begins.

- Improved Communication: Acts as a bridge between stakeholders and the development team, ensuring shared understanding.

- Reduced Costs and Rework: Detecting requirement issues early helps avoid costly changes during later stages.

- Better Project Planning: Provides a foundation for estimating resources, timelines, and budgets accurately.

- Enhanced Quality: Ensures the final product meets user needs, improving satisfaction and usability.

- In short, Requirement Analysis is the blueprint of software development ‚Äî without it, even the best code can fail to meet real-world needs.
