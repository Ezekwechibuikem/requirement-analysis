## Requirement Analysis in Software Development
📘 About the Project

The Requirement Analysis Project builds a solid foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system.
This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to ensure successful project execution.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

Master the principles and methodologies of Requirement Analysis within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

Translate project needs into structured documentation.

Identify and categorize functional and non-functional requirements for scalable systems.

Use tools like Draw.io for visual system representations.

Define clear acceptance criteria that align with user and business goals.

Apply best practices to produce industry-standard documentation and diagrams.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It serves as the foundation of the Software Development Life Cycle (SOLC), ensuring that the final product aligns with user goals, business objectives, and technical feasibility.

During this phase, developers, project managers, and stakeholders collaborate to define what the system should do (functional requirements) and how it should perform (non-functional requirements). The outcome is a clear, structured set of requirements that guide the design, development, and testing stages of the project.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

### Requirement Analysis involves several important activities to ensure the software meets user expectations and business goals.

Below are the five key activities involved:

- Requirement Gathering
Collecting all relevant information from stakeholders, users, and clients to understand what the system should do. This may involve interviews, surveys, or reviewing existing documentation.

- Requirement Elicitation
Engaging stakeholders through discussions, workshops, and observation to uncover hidden needs and clarify ambiguous requirements.

- Requirement Documentation
Organizing and writing down all gathered and elicited requirements in a clear, structured format (e.g., Software Requirement Specification - SRS) for easy understanding by both technical and non-technical teams.

- Requirement Analysis and Modeling
Evaluating requirements for feasibility, consistency, and completeness. Creating models such as data flow diagrams (DFDs), use cases, or UML diagrams to represent the system’s functionality visually.

- Requirement Validation
Ensuring that the documented requirements align with the actual needs of users and stakeholders. This step helps identify missing, conflicting, or misunderstood requirements before development begins.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it ensures that the project starts with a clear understanding of user needs and business goals. Here are three key reasons why it’s important:

### 1. Prevents Miscommunication and Scope Creep
By clearly defining what the system should do, Requirement Analysis reduces misunderstandings between developers, clients, and stakeholders. This helps prevent costly changes or “scope creep” during development.

### 2. Saves Time and Resources
Identifying requirements early helps detect potential risks and technical challenges before development begins. This reduces rework and ensures the project stays on schedule and within budget.

### 3. Improves Software Quality
A well-defined set of requirements acts as a guide for design, coding, and testing. It ensures that the final product aligns with user expectations and business objectives, resulting in higher-quality software.
